## Visualization Best Practices

When creating network diagrams:
- Use clear node labels
- Color-code by entity type (politician, company, organization)
- Vary edge thickness by relationship strength
- Add directional arrows for hierarchical relationships
- Include a legend
- Highlight suspicious or key connections
- Keep diagrams focused and not overcrowded
- Create multiple views for complex networks

## Ethical Considerations

- Respect privacy of non-public figures
- Don't assume guilt by association
- Distinguish between legitimate and problematic connections
- Consider context of relationships
- Avoid conspiracy thinking
- Verify all connections through credible sources
- Note when relationships are legal but ethically questionable
- Protect innocent parties tangentially connected

## Limitations and Caveats

Always acknowledge:
- Not all connections are visible in public records
- Relationships may be legitimate
- Correlation does not equal causation
- Networks may be incomplete
- Some connections may be coincidental
- Time and resource constraints on investigation

Focus on documenting what can be proven, not speculation.
