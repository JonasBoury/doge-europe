# DOGE Europe - Strategic Goals

## Mission

Expose government inefficiency, demand accountability, and drive systemic reform through transparency and data-driven investigation.

---

## Primary Goals (2026)

### Goal 1: Secure National Mandate to Investigate 🎯

**Objective:** Obtain official recognition and authorization to conduct independent investigations into Belgian government failures.

**Why This Matters:**
- Legitimizes DOGE Europe's investigative work
- Grants access to official documents and records
- Creates legal protection for investigators
- Signals institutional accountability commitment

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Parliamentary recognition of DOGE Europe investigation authority
- [ ] Access to FOI (Freedom of Information) requests with government cooperation
- [ ] Formal hearings where DOGE findings are considered
- [ ] Official collaboration with transparency/audit institutions

**Milestones:**
1. **Q1 2026:** Publish Brussels investigation findings with irrefutable data
2. **Q2 2026:** Secure media coverage forcing political response
3. **Q3 2026:** Present findings to parliamentary committees
4. **Q4 2026:** Obtain formal investigative mandate or partnership

**Key Strategies:**
- Demonstrate investigative rigor through Brussels case
- Build public pressure via transparency tools (Coalition Builder)
- Partner with existing accountability institutions
- Engage sympathetic politicians across party lines
- Create undeniable evidence of government failure

**Obstacles:**
- Political resistance from implicated parties
- Institutional inertia ("who are you to investigate us?")
- Legal barriers to document access
- Media capture by political interests

**Countermeasures:**
- Public transparency: publish all findings openly
- Citizen engagement: build grassroots support
- Legal strategy: use existing FOI laws aggressively
- International precedent: reference successful DOGE-style initiatives elsewhere

### Goal 2: Raise €100,000 from Citizens 💰

**Objective:** Prove value to citizens by securing €100,000 in crowdfunded support, demonstrating public demand for accountability.

**Why This Matters:**
- Financial independence from political interests
- Validates citizen demand for DOGE mission
- Enables full-time investigative capacity
- Proves sustainability before scaling

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] €100,000 total raised from individual citizens
- [ ] 1,000+ individual contributors (avg €100 each)
- [ ] Recurring monthly donations: €10,000/month
- [ ] Zero corporate or political party funding

**Milestones:**
1. **Launch (Q1 2026):** Initial crowdfunding campaign with Brussels findings
2. **€25K (Q2 2026):** Prove concept, hire part-time investigator
3. **€50K (Q2-Q3 2026):** Expand to second investigation case
4. **€75K (Q3 2026):** Build sustainable monthly donor base
5. **€100K (Q4 2026):** Goal achieved, scale operations

**Revenue Streams:**
- **One-time donations:** Campaign around major investigation releases
- **Monthly subscriptions:** €5-50/month for transparency reports
- **Crowdfunding platforms:** Patreon, Ko-fi, custom solution
- **Merchandise:** DOGE Europe branded items (transparency over profit)

**Value Proposition to Citizens:**

*"For the price of a Netflix subscription (€10/month), fund independent investigations that politicians fear. We publish everything. No paywall. No corporate sponsors. Just accountability."*

**Milestones to Unlock Funding:**
- ✅ Brussels investigation published (completed)
- ✅ Coalition Builder tool live (completed)
- 🔄 AI Policy Calculator functional (in progress)
- ⏳ Media coverage of findings
- ⏳ First political response to investigation
- ⏳ Visible impact (policy change, resignations, or public pressure)

**Obstacles:**
- Building trust (who are we? why donate?)
- Competition for attention (many causes)
- Skepticism about impact ("will this change anything?")
- Technical barriers (payment processing, recurring billing)

**Countermeasures:**
- Full transparency: publish all finances, investigations, methodology
- Prove impact: show tangible results from first €25K
- Regular updates: weekly investigation progress reports
- Community engagement: donors vote on next investigation targets
- Low barrier to entry: €5/month tier for students/low-income supporters
