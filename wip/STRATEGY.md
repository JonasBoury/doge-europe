# DOGE Europe - Strategic Roadmap

**Purpose:** This document outlines the path from current state (investigation published) to achieving our two primary goals: national mandate and €100K citizen funding.

---

## Current State (January 2026)

### What We Have ✅
- Comprehensive Brussels investigation (572-day crisis documented)
- Coalition Builder web app with AI Policy Calculator
- Network analysis revealing structural deadlock
- Technical proof-of-concept demonstrating capability
- Open-source codebase and transparent methodology

### What We Lack ❌
- Public awareness (investigation not widely known)
- Media coverage (zero mainstream press)
- Citizen funding (€0 raised)
- Political recognition (no mandate)
- Community/supporters (no organized base)
- Legal entity (unclear organizational structure)

---

## Theory of Change

### How We Win

**The Cycle:**
```
Investigation Quality
    ↓
Media Coverage
    ↓
Public Awareness
    ↓
Citizen Support (€ + volunteers)
    ↓
Political Pressure
    ↓
Mandate Granted
    ↓
More Resources
    ↓
Better Investigations
    ↓
[CYCLE REPEATS, AMPLIFIED]
```

**Key Insight:** We must trigger this cycle by forcing media coverage of our first investigation. Everything else follows.

---

## Phase 1: Launch & Media Coverage (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Goal:** Get Brussels investigation into mainstream media, forcing political response.

### Strategy: "Make It Impossible to Ignore"

#### Tactic 1: Journalist Direct Outreach
- Identify 20 investigative journalists across Belgian media
- Personalized pitches highlighting:
  - Data-driven approach (not opinion)
  - Interactive tools (Coalition Builder - novel angle)
  - AI Policy Calculator (tech + politics story)
  - Specific names (Open VLD obstruction score)
- Offer exclusive first coverage to top-tier outlet

**Target Journalists:**
- De Standaard: Bart Brinckman, Isolde Van Den Eynde
- Le Soir: Dominique Berns, Véronique Lamquin
- RTBF: Julian Vickery (investigations)
- VRT: Johny Vansevenant (Panorama)
- Knack: Alain Mouton, Rik Van Cauwelaert
- Apache.be: Daan Killemaes

#### Tactic 2: Social Media Virality
- Twitter/X thread summarizing findings (15-20 tweets)
  - Lead with shocking stat: "572 days. €X million wasted. Here's why."
  - Visualizations from Coalition Builder
  - Name names: "Open VLD (2 seats) is blocking 89 viable coalitions"
  - End with CTA: Explore the tool yourself
- Post to Reddit r/belgium, r/Brussels, r/dataisbeautiful
- LinkedIn article targeting political/policy audience
- Tag relevant politicians, journalists, transparency advocates

#### Tactic 3: Political Provocation
- Send investigation report directly to:
  - All Brussels Parliament party leaders
  - Federal transparency/audit officials
  - European transparency networks
- Frame as: "We've done the analysis you failed to commission. Respond."
- Demand response within 14 days
- Publish their responses (or silence) publicly

#### Tactic 4: Academic Validation
- Submit to VUB/ULB political science departments for peer review
- Present at academic conference/seminar
- Publish methodology paper (if credible venue available)
- Goal: Third-party validation to counter "who are these guys?" skepticism

### Success Metrics (Phase 1)
- [ ] At least 1 major media article (De Standaard, Le Soir, VRT, RTBF)
- [ ] 10,000+ social media impressions
- [ ] 5+ political responses (even if dismissive)
- [ ] 500+ Coalition Builder users
- [ ] 100+ newsletter signups

---

## Phase 2: Community Building & Fundraising (Feb-Apr 2026)

**Goal:** Convert media attention into organized support and initial funding.

### Strategy: "Prove the Value, Ask for Support"

#### Tactic 1: Crowdfunding Campaign Launch
**Timing:** Immediately after first major media coverage

**Pitch:**
*"You just saw our Brussels investigation force politicians to respond. We did this with zero budget, in our spare time. Imagine what we could do with €25,000 - a full-time investigator for 3 months on the case YOU choose. We're crowdfunding €100K to prove citizens want accountability. Will you chip in €10/month?"*

**Campaign Assets:**
- 3-minute video explaining Brussels findings
- Donor tiers with clear impact ("€10/month = 2 hours of investigation")
- Transparent budget breakdown
- Regular progress updates (weekly newsletter)

**Platforms:**
- Patreon for recurring donations
- GoFundMe or custom solution for one-time gifts
- Cryptocurrency option (transparency + international donors)

#### Tactic 2: Newsletter & Community
- Weekly investigation updates
- Behind-the-scenes methodology insights
- Donor Q&A sessions
- Exclusive early access to findings before publication
- Discord/forum for discussion

#### Tactic 3: Volunteer Recruitment
- Open call for volunteer investigators
- Skills needed: Data analysis, journalism, legal research, visualization
- Onboarding process with investigation handbook
- Credit volunteers in published work

### Success Metrics (Phase 2)
- [ ] €25K raised (quarter of goal)
- [ ] 250+ recurring monthly donors
- [ ] 1,000+ newsletter subscribers
- [ ] 10+ active volunteer investigators
- [ ] Second investigation case selected by donors

---

## Phase 3: Credibility & Scale (Apr-Jul 2026)

**Goal:** Publish second investigation, demonstrating sustainability and rigor.

### Strategy: "Prove This Wasn't a Fluke"

#### Tactic 1: Second Investigation Selection
- Donor vote on 3 pre-researched cases
- Options (examples):
  1. Belgian Federal Formation 2019-2020 (652 days)
  2. Brussels Metro Extension delays (decades, billions over budget)
  3. COVID-19 fragmented response (9 health ministers failure)
- Transparency: Show research process, data availability assessment

#### Tactic 2: Methodology Refinement
- Apply lessons from Brussels case
- Improve tools (faster data collection, better visualization)
- Document workflow for replicability
- Publish investigation handbook publicly

#### Tactic 3: Partnership Building
- Collaborate with transparency NGOs (Transparency International Belgium, Apache.be)
- Offer tools/findings to academic researchers (credit us)
- Joint investigations with established outlets
- Build European DOGE network (connect with similar initiatives)

### Success Metrics (Phase 3)
- [ ] Second investigation published (60-day timeline)
- [ ] €50K fundraising milestone reached
- [ ] 2+ media citations of second investigation
- [ ] 1+ formal partnership with transparency organization
- [ ] Coalition Builder used by journalists/academics (evidence: citations)

---

## Phase 4: Political Engagement (Jul-Oct 2026)

**Goal:** Force political system to grant mandate or formal recognition.

### Strategy: "Make Ignoring Us More Costly Than Engaging"

#### Tactic 1: Parliamentary Presentations
- Request hearings in relevant committees
- Present Brussels findings + proposed reforms
- Demand response: Will you adopt these recommendations?
- Publicly track which parties support/oppose

#### Tactic 2: Reform Proposal Campaign
- Draft specific legislative amendments based on findings
- Example: Reform linguistic parity rule to prevent 2-seat veto
- Identify sympathetic MPs to sponsor
- Build public campaign: "Tell your MP to support Reform X"

#### Tactic 3: Institutional Partnerships
- Propose collaboration with Court of Audit
- Offer investigation capacity to Ombudsman office
- Create MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with transparency agencies
- Position as: "We do the work, you provide legitimacy"

#### Tactic 4: Public Pressure Campaigns
- If parties ignore findings: Name and shame
- "Open VLD has refused to respond for 90 days. Here's how to contact them."
- Coordinate citizen actions (emails, phone calls, protests)
- Track political responses publicly (scorecard)

### Success Metrics (Phase 4)
- [ ] €75K fundraising milestone
- [ ] Parliamentary hearing held OR formal partnership established
- [ ] 1+ reform proposal adopted/debated
- [ ] 5,000+ citizen actions (emails/calls to politicians)
- [ ] Media recognition as legitimate accountability force

---

## Phase 5: Institutionalization (Oct-Dec 2026)

**Goal:** Achieve €100K funding and secure ongoing mandate.

### Strategy: "Become Undeniable"

#### Tactic 1: €100K Fundraising Push
- Major campaign showcasing impact:
  - "2 investigations. 3 reform proposals. 1 political scandal exposed. €100K = we go full-time."
- Highlight sustainability: Recurring donors fund ongoing work
- Transparency report: Show every euro spent, results achieved

#### Tactic 2: Mandate Negotiation
**Options:**
1. **Official Parliamentary Recognition:** Formal investigative authority
2. **Partnership with Court of Audit:** Outsourced investigation capacity
3. **Government Grant:** Conditional on independence guarantees
4. **Legal Entity Recognition:** Nonprofit/foundation status with tax benefits

**Leverage:**
- Public support (€100K from citizens = mandate)
- Media pressure (investigations driving coverage)
- Political necessity (parties need scapegoat for failures)

#### Tactic 3: Third Investigation Launch
- Demonstrate capacity for sustained operation
- Pick high-profile case (federal-level if possible)
- Show DOGE Europe is here to stay

### Success Metrics (Phase 5)
- [ ] €100K total raised
- [ ] €10K/month recurring donation base
- [ ] Official mandate granted OR equivalent partnership
- [ ] 3 investigations published in 12 months
- [ ] 2+ tangible reforms attributable to DOGE findings

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Media Blackout
**Mitigation:**
- Build direct audience (newsletter, social media)
- Leverage international media (EU transparency outlets)
- Use Reddit, Twitter/X for grassroots virality
- Partner with existing investigative platforms (Apache.be)

### Risk 2: Political Retaliation
**Mitigation:**
- Legal partnership with press freedom organizations
- Document everything, publish immediately
- International hosting for website (protection from Belgian censorship)
- Decentralized backups (blockchain, IPFS)

### Risk 3: Funding Failure
**Mitigation:**
- Low burn rate (volunteer-heavy initially)
- Diversified revenue (one-time + recurring)
- Transparent budget builds trust
- Prove value before asking for more

### Risk 4: Credibility Attacks
**Mitigation:**
- Full transparency (publish methodology, sources, finances)
- Academic validation where possible
- Admit mistakes publicly and correct
- Non-partisan: Investigate all parties equally

## Decision Points

### By March 2026: Pivot or Persist?
**Question:** Has Phase 1 worked? Do we have media coverage and early funding?

**If Yes:** Proceed to Phase 2 (community building)
**If No:**
- Reassess media strategy (different journalists? international angle?)
- Consider more provocative tactics (leak findings to foreign press?)
- Evaluate if investigation quality is insufficient

### By June 2026: Sustainability Check
**Question:** Have we reached €50K and proven replicability (second investigation)?

**If Yes:** Proceed to Phase 3 (scale up)
**If No:**
- Slow down, focus on quality over quantity
- Engage existing donors more deeply
- Consider whether €100K goal is realistic

### By September 2026: Mandate Strategy
**Question:** Is political mandate achievable, or should we pursue alternative models?

**Options:**
1. Continue pushing for official mandate
2. Accept informal role as watchdog
3. Formalize partnerships instead of seeking mandate
4. Pivot to European-level investigations (EU institutions)

---

## Success Scenarios

### Best Case (90th Percentile)
- Brussels investigation goes viral, multiple major media outlets
- €100K raised by June 2026 (6 months ahead)
- Parliamentary mandate granted by September 2026
- 5+ investigations published in first year
- DOGE Europe becomes household name for accountability

### Expected Case (50th Percentile)
- 1-2 media articles, moderate social media engagement
- €100K raised by December 2026 (on target)
- Formal partnership established (not full mandate)
- 3 investigations published in first year
- DOGE Europe recognized by transparency advocates, niche political audience

### Worst Case (10th Percentile)
- Minimal media coverage, investigation mostly ignored
- €25-50K raised (short of goal)
- No official recognition, remain independent watchdog
- 2 investigations published in first year
- Small but dedicated supporter base

**Mitigation for Worst Case:**
- Adjust expectations: €50K is still success (part-time capacity)
- Focus on quality over scale
- Build slowly, prove value long-term
- International expansion if Belgian market too resistant
