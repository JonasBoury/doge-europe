   - Track from source to destination
   - Identify all intermediaries
   - Note shell companies and offshore entities
   - Follow through complex structures
   - Document each transaction

3. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Look for unusual patterns
   - Compare against norms
   - Identify inflated costs
   - Spot structured transactions
   - Find unexplained wealth

4. **Calculate Totals**
   - Sum total amounts involved
   - Calculate overcharges
   - Estimate losses or gains
   - Quantify financial impact
   - Show the bottom line

5. **Document Everything**
   - Get financial documents
   - Screenshot transaction records
   - Save invoices and receipts

### Financial Analysis Techniques

**Ratio Analysis:**
- Cost per unit ($/square meter, $/item)
- Profit margins (% markup)
- Growth rates (year-over-year change)
- Efficiency ratios (cost vs. output)

**Comparative Analysis:**
- This project vs. similar projects
- This year vs. previous years
- Market rate vs. actual cost
- Disclosed income vs. wealth accumulation

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Transaction timing (around key events?)
- Amount patterns (round numbers? just under limits?)
- Frequency (regular payments? one-offs?)
- Geographic patterns (offshore? local?)

**Net Worth Analysis:**
Known income - known expenses = expected wealth
Compare to actual declared wealth
Unexplained difference = red flag

### Red Flags to Highlight

**Transaction Red Flags:**
- Round numbers (EUR 100,000 vs. EUR 97,342)
- Just below reporting thresholds
- Suspicious timing (before/after key decisions)
- Payments to shell companies
- Offshore transfers
- Large cash transactions
- Structured deposits

**Procurement Red Flags:**
- Single bidder
- Winning bid just below competitor
- No competitive bidding
- Vague specifications
- Repeated contract amendments
- Costs far above market
- Split contracts to avoid oversight

**Personal Finance Red Flags:**
- Assets exceeding income
- Sudden wealth increases
- Luxury purchases unexplained
- Family members with questionable income
- Offshore holdings
- Undisclosed interests

### Calculations to Include

Always show:
- Total amounts (sum everything)
- Averages (what's typical)
- Variances (difference from norm)
- Percentages (how much more/less)
- Growth rates (change over time)
- Per-unit costs (normalize for comparison)

**Example Calculations:**
```
Contract Amount: EUR 1,500,000
Market Rate Estimate: EUR 1,000,000
Overcharge: EUR 500,000 (50% above market)

Similar 5 Projects Average: EUR 980,000
This Project: EUR 1,500,000
Variance: +53.1% above average
```

### Ethical Considerations

**Do:**

- Show all calculations transparently

**Don't:**
- Assume wealth equals guilt
