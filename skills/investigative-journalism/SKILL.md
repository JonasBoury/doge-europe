# Investigative Journalism Skills

## Core Principles

### The Five W's and H
Every investigation should answer:
- **Who**: All relevant actors
- **What**: What happened
- **When**: Timeline of events
- **Where**: Locations involved
- **Why**: Motivations and causes
- **How**: Methods and mechanisms

### Standards of Proof
1. **On the record**: Named source, can be quoted
2. **On background**: Information can be used but not attributed
3. **Off the record**: For context only, cannot be used
4. **Deep background**: Information can be used without any attribution

### Verification Requirements
- **Two-source rule**: Major allegations need at least two independent sources
- **Document everything**: Keep records of all research and communication
- **Assume nothing**: Verify even "obvious" facts
- **Be skeptical but fair**: Question everything but remain objective

## OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Techniques

### Web Research Fundamentals

**Search Operators:**
```
site:belgium.be "public contract"
intitle:"confidential" filetype:pdf
inurl:admin site:.be
"politician name" + scandal -wikipedia
related:apache.be
cache:example.com
```

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Reverse image search (Google, TinEye, Yandex)
- Wayback Machine for historical websites
- WHOIS lookups for domain ownership
- Metadata analysis (EXIF data, document properties)
- Social media archive tools

### Social Media Investigation

**Platform-Specific Techniques:**
- **Twitter/X**: Advanced search, Who to Follow connections, analytics
- **Facebook**: Graph Search, page transparency, archive
- **LinkedIn**: Connection mapping, job histories, company relationships
- **Instagram**: Location tags, hashtag tracking, archived stories

**Red Flags:**
- Newly created accounts
- Suspicious follower patterns
- Bot-like posting behavior
- Coordinated messaging
- Stock photos as profiles

### Public Records Research

**Essential Databases:**
- Company registries (KBO/BCE in Belgium)
- Property/land registries (Cadaster)
- Court records
- Government contract databases
- Lobbying registries
- Professional licensing boards

**Document Sources:**
- Official gazettes
- Parliamentary records
- Freedom of Information responses
- Regulatory filings
- Annual reports

## Source Development

### Finding Sources

**Where to Look:**
- Former employees ("latent sources")
- Competitors and rivals
- Regulatory agency contacts
- Academic experts
- Whistleblower platforms
- Industry conferences
- Professional associations

**Approach Strategies:**
- Start with peripheral sources, work inward
- Use mutual connections for introductions
- Attend public events where targets speak
- Build trust gradually
- Protect source identity from the start

### Working with Sources

**Building Trust:**
- Be transparent about your intentions
- Explain how you'll protect them
- Follow through on promises
- Respect boundaries
- Maintain regular contact

**Source Protection:**
- Use encrypted communications (Signal, ProtonMail)
- Meet in secure locations
- Remove identifying details
- Use "composite sources" when appropriate
- Never reveal sources without permission
- Be prepared for legal pressure

**Evaluating Sources:**
- What's their motive for talking?
- Do they have direct knowledge?
- Can they provide documentation?
- Do other sources corroborate?
- Are they credible and reliable?

## Interview Techniques

### Preparation
- Research subject thoroughly
- Prepare question outline (but stay flexible)
- Know the key facts already
- Anticipate deflections
- Have documents ready to reference

### Interview Strategy

**Types of Interviews:**
- **Friendly**: Building rapport with cooperative sources
- **Adversarial**: Confronting subjects with allegations
- **Ambush**: Last resort when subject won't cooperate

**Questioning Techniques:**
- Open-ended questions to start
- Specific questions for key facts
- Silence is powerful - let them fill it
- Ask "how" and "why" not just "what"
- Circle back to catch inconsistencies
- Save hardest questions for end

**Recording:**
- Always ask permission to record
- Take notes even when recording
- Record in-person when allowed
- Keep recordings securely
- Transcribe key sections

### Red Flags in Interviews
- Refusing to answer basic questions
- Overly rehearsed responses
- Deflection and topic-changing
- Attacking the investigator
- "I don't recall" to everything
- Threatening legal action prematurely

## Document Analysis

### Finding Documents
