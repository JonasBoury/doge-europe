# Belgian Politics Knowledge Skill

## Political Structure

### Federal System
Belgium is a federal state with a complex multi-level governance structure:

**Three Levels of Government:**
1. **Federal Government** - National issues (foreign affairs, defense, justice, social security, etc.)
2. **Regional Governments** (3) - Territory-based (economic policy, environment, agriculture, etc.)
3. **Community Governments** (3) - Language-based (education, culture, some health matters)

### The Six Entities

**Regions:**
1. **Flemish Region** (Flanders) - Dutch-speaking
2. **Walloon Region** (Wallonia) - French-speaking (+ small German-speaking area)
3. **Brussels-Capital Region** - Officially bilingual (French/Dutch)

**Communities:**
1. **Flemish Community** - Dutch speakers (Flanders + Brussels)
2. **French Community** - French speakers (Wallonia + Brussels)
3. **German-speaking Community** - Small eastern area

**Note:** Flanders merged Regional and Community governments (Flemish Government)

### Federal Government Structure

**Legislature:**
- **Chamber of Representatives** (150 members) - Direct election
- **Senate** (60 members) - Mostly appointed by regional parliaments

**Executive:**
