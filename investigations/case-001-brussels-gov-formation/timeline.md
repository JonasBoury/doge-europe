## Research Priorities

### Immediate Timeline Gaps to Fill:

1. **Exact election date** (June 2024)
2. **Formateur/informateur appointments** and their mandates
3. **Specific coalition formation attempts** with dates and configurations
4. **Public protests and civil society reactions** with dates
5. **Budget crisis milestones** and caretaker government responses
6. **Media coverage peaks** and public pressure points
7. **Party statements on vetoes** and red lines with dates
8. **Accountability body actions** (or inaction) with dates
9. **Economic impact reports** released during the period
10. **Comparative milestones** to 2010-2011 federal crisis

### Key Questions for Timeline Development:

- When did party vetoes (PS-N-VA, Open VLD demands) become publicly explicit?
- Were there moments when breakthrough seemed possible? What happened?
- When did the "toxic" negotiation climate emerge?
- What external events (federal politics, economic shocks) affected the timeline?
- Were there calls for institutional reform or intervention? When and by whom?
