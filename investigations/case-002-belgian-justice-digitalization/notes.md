# Research Notes: Digitalization of the Belgian Justice System

## Working Hypotheses

1. **Governance fragmentation hypothesis:** Frequent ministerial changes and lack of a dedicated digital governance body led to inconsistent strategy and repeated restarts of IT projects.

2. **Vendor capture hypothesis:** A small number of IT vendors dominated justice IT procurement, leading to vendor lock-in, high costs, and limited innovation.

3. **Structural underinvestment hypothesis:** Despite headline budget figures, actual investment in justice IT was consistently insufficient relative to the scale of modernization needed.

## Initial Research Findings

*(To be populated as research progresses)*

## Key Areas to Investigate

### Budget Analysis
- Total IT spending by FOD Justitie per year (2010-2025)
- Breakdown by project (MaCH, SIDIS, Just-on-web, e-Deposit, etc.)
- Comparison of budgeted vs. actual spending
- Cost overruns and their causes

### Project Outcomes
- Status of each major IT project (delivered, delayed, abandoned)
- User adoption rates for digital tools
- Impact on case processing times

### Procurement
- Major IT contracts and vendors
- Procurement procedures used (open tender, framework agreements, etc.)
- Any irregularities flagged by audit bodies

### Political Accountability
- Ministers responsible for justice IT during each period
- Political commitments vs. actual delivery
- Parliamentary scrutiny and follow-up

## Questions to Resolve

- [ ] What is the total cumulative spending on justice IT since 2010?
- [ ] Which specific projects were abandoned and at what cost?
- [ ] What did the Court of Audit specifically recommend, and were recommendations followed?
- [ ] How many courts currently use MaCH vs. legacy systems?
- [ ] What is the current status of Just-on-web adoption?
- [ ] How does Belgium rank in the EU Justice Scoreboard on digitalization metrics?

## Research Progress

- [ ] Court of Audit report analysis
- [ ] Parliamentary question compilation
- [ ] Budget data collection
- [ ] Vendor contract analysis
