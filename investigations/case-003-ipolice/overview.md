# Case Overview: iPolice — Belgian Police IT Modernization Project

## Case Metadata

- **Case ID:** case-003-ipolice
- **Status:** Active Investigation
- **Date Opened:** 2026-01-28
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-28
- **Priority:** High
- **Lead Investigator:** DOGE Europe Research Team

## Executive Summary

The iPolice program is Belgium's flagship IT modernization project for the integrated police force (federal and local police). Launched to replace the aging ISLP (Integrated System for Local Police) infrastructure, iPolice aims to provide a modern, unified information system for all Belgian police zones. The project has been plagued by massive cost overruns, repeated delays, and questions about procurement integrity. Initial budget estimates have ballooned significantly, while delivery timelines have been pushed back multiple times.

This DOGE Europe investigation examines the **governance, procurement, spending, and delivery failures** of the iPolice program. The investigation will assess whether taxpayer money was spent effectively, whether procurement rules were respected, and what accountability mechanisms exist for one of Belgium's largest government IT projects.

## Key Questions

### Primary Investigation Questions

1. **Cost Overruns:** What was the original budget for iPolice, how much has been spent to date, and what is the current estimated total cost?

2. **Delivery Failures:** What functionality was promised, what has actually been delivered, and how many times has the timeline been revised?

3. **Procurement Integrity:** Were procurement processes conducted transparently and competitively, and were there any irregularities?

4. **Governance Structure:** Who is responsible for overseeing the iPolice program, and have governance structures been adequate?

5. **Operational Impact:** What is the impact of delayed modernization on police operations, data sharing, and public safety?

### Secondary Questions

6. What role did the consortium of IT vendors play in cost overruns and delays?

7. Were there conflicts of interest between procurement decision-makers and selected vendors?

8. How does the iPolice program compare to police IT modernization in neighboring countries?

9. What did parliamentary oversight and Court of Audit reviews reveal about the project?

10. What is the current realistic timeline for full deployment, and is the project still viable?

## Background

Belgium's police force was restructured in 2001 following the Dutroux affair, creating an integrated police system with a federal police force and 185 local police zones. The IT infrastructure supporting this integrated model has been a persistent challenge. The ISLP system, developed in the early 2000s, became increasingly outdated, prompting the iPolice modernization program.

Key contextual factors include:
- **Fragmented police landscape:** 185 local police zones plus federal police, each with varying IT needs and capabilities
- **Data sharing requirements:** Police effectiveness depends on seamless information exchange between zones and with federal police
- **Security requirements:** Police IT systems require high security standards, adding complexity and cost
- **Political sensitivity:** Police budgets and operations are politically sensitive, affecting oversight willingness

## Investigation Scope

### In Scope
- Full financial history of the iPolice program (original budget through current spending)
- Procurement processes and vendor selection
- Delivery milestones: planned vs. actual
- Court of Audit reports and parliamentary oversight
- Impact on police operations and data sharing capabilities
- Comparison with police IT programs in peer countries

### Out of Scope
- Operational police matters (ongoing investigations, personnel)
- Classified security aspects of police IT systems
- Individual police zone budgets unrelated to iPolice

## Deliverables

1. Complete financial analysis of the iPolice program
2. Procurement timeline and vendor analysis
3. Delivery gap analysis (promised vs. delivered)
4. Governance and accountability mapping
5. Comparative analysis with peer countries
6. Recommendations for program governance reform
