# Research Notes: iPolice — Belgian Police IT Modernization Project

## Working Hypotheses

1. **Scope creep hypothesis:** The iPolice program suffered from continuously expanding requirements, driven by the complexity of 185+ police zones with varying needs.

2. **Procurement failure hypothesis:** The vendor selection process prioritized established relationships over technical capability and competitive pricing.

3. **Governance gap hypothesis:** No single authority had sufficient mandate and expertise to steer a program of this scale across federal and local police.

## Initial Research Findings

*(To be populated as research progresses)*

## Key Areas to Investigate

### Financial Analysis
- Original budget vs. current total cost
- Annual spending breakdown
- Cost per police zone
- Comparison with peer country police IT budgets

### Procurement Review
- Tender specifications and evaluation criteria
- Number of bidders and selection rationale
- Contract amendments and change orders
- Vendor performance assessments

### Delivery Assessment
- Planned deployment milestones vs. actual delivery
- Functionality delivered vs. promised
- User satisfaction among police officers
- Data sharing capabilities achieved

### Governance Review
- Program governance structure
- Decision-making authority and escalation paths
- Risk management practices
- Stakeholder management (185 local zones + federal)

## Questions to Resolve

- [ ] What is the exact current total cost of the iPolice program?
- [ ] How many police zones are currently using iPolice vs. ISLP?
- [ ] What specific functionality gaps exist compared to the original specification?
- [ ] What did the Court of Audit find in its review(s)?
- [ ] Who are the main IT vendors involved and what are their contract values?
- [ ] What is the current realistic timeline for full deployment?

## Research Progress
