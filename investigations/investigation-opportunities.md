## 1. Revolving-Door Politics and Conflicts of Interest

**Priority:** High
**Scope:** Belgium (Federal & Regional)

### Overview
Probe former politicians transitioning to lucrative roles in sectors they influenced. Examples include Kris Peeters (CD&V) joining Aquafin after approving a €200M loan via the European Investment Bank, or historical cases like Etienne Schouppe (NMBS links), Karel Vinck (transport/energy boards), and Guy Verhofstadt (Exmar energy board).

### Investigation Objectives
- Audit recent appointments for *belangenvermenging* (conflicts of interest)
- Quantify financial benefits to individuals vs. public interest
- Map politician-to-private sector transitions in key sectors (energy, transport, water, defense)
- Identify regulatory gaps enabling revolving-door practices

### Key Entities to Investigate
- **Kris Peeters (CD&V)** → Aquafin appointment, €200M EIB loan connection
- **Etienne Schouppe** → NMBS links
- **Karel Vinck** → Transport/energy boards
- **Guy Verhofstadt** → Exmar energy board
- Recent ministerial appointments (2020-2025)

### Expected Deliverables
- Database of politician-to-private transitions (last 10 years)
- Financial impact analysis (public funds vs. private gains)
- Policy recommendations for cooling-off periods and disclosure requirements

## 2. Subsidy and Social Program Fraud

**Priority:** High
**Scope:** Belgium (Federal, Regional, and Local)

### Overview
Investigate potential abuses in welfare, housing, and childcare subsidies, mirroring US cases (e.g., Minnesota daycare fraud). X posts highlight Flanders using household waste data to detect social housing fraud. Expand to nationwide checks on immigrant-heavy programs, NGO subsidies, and association funding—especially where funds go to politically connected entities without oversight.

### Investigation Objectives
- Audit welfare, housing, and childcare subsidy programs for fraud patterns
- Analyze Flanders' waste data detection methods and scalability
- Investigate NGO and association funding for political connections and lack of oversight
- Quantify fraud rates and financial losses across programs

### Key Areas
- Social housing fraud detection systems
- Childcare subsidy verification processes
- NGO funding transparency (recipient organizations, political ties)
- Association subsidies without proper accountability
- Immigrant-focused programs with oversight gaps

### Expected Deliverables
- Fraud detection methodology assessment
- Estimated financial losses from subsidy abuse
- Network maps of politically connected subsidy recipients
- Technology recommendations for fraud prevention

## 3. EU Green Deal and NGO Lobbying Funding

**Priority:** High
**Scope:** European Union (Brussels-based)

### Overview
Examine billions in taxpayer funds funneled to NGOs for promoting Green Deal policies under Frans Timmermans. Allegations point to secretive payments and conflicts (e.g., family ties or insider deals). Audit €7.5B+ allocations for transparency, results, and whether funds effectively lobbied for policies harming sectors like Dutch/Belgian farming or shrimp industries.

### Investigation Objectives
- Trace €7.5B+ in Green Deal NGO funding allocations
- Identify conflicts of interest (family ties, insider deals) in fund distribution
- Assess transparency and accountability of NGO payments
- Analyze policy outcomes vs. funding inputs (effectiveness audit)
- Document impact on affected industries (farming, fishing, energy)

### Key Entities
- **Frans Timmermans** - Former European Commission Executive VP
- NGOs receiving Green Deal lobbying funds
- European Commission funding mechanisms
- Affected sectors: Dutch/Belgian farming, shrimp industries

### Expected Deliverables
- Complete funding flow map (EU → NGOs → lobbying activities)
- Conflict of interest documentation
- Cost-benefit analysis of Green Deal policies vs. funding spent
- Industry impact assessment

## 4. Defense and Public Procurement Scandals

**Priority:** Medium-High
**Scope:** Belgium (Federal) & NATO

### Overview
Review major contracts for irregularities, building on past scandals (Agusta-Dassault bribes, Asco F-16 parts, Willy Claes NATO fallout). Scrutinize F-35 purchases and energy infrastructure (e.g., rumored kickbacks in offshore projects). Demand full disclosure of lobbying influences and compare costs to alternatives for waste detection.

### Investigation Objectives
- Audit F-35 fighter jet procurement process and costs
- Investigate energy infrastructure contracts (offshore wind, nuclear)
- Review lobbying influences on major defense and infrastructure decisions
- Comparative analysis: Belgian costs vs. international benchmarks
- Identify waste, kickbacks, or irregularities in procurement

### Historical Context
- **Agusta-Dassault scandal** (1988-1998) - helicopter bribery
- **Asco F-16 parts scandal** - procurement irregularities
- **Willy Claes NATO resignation** (1995) - corruption allegations

### Expected Deliverables
- F-35 procurement transparency report
- Lobbying influence network map
- Cost comparison analysis (Belgium vs. peer nations)
- Recommendations for procurement reform

## 5. Structural Government Waste and Overlap

**Priority:** High
**Scope:** Belgium (Multi-level governance)

### Overview
Analyze Belgium's multi-layered system (federal, regional, community governments) for duplication—cited as enabling high politician counts (36,000+ roles) and inefficiency. Quantify savings from streamlining (e.g., one parliament/administration) and probe nepotism in appointments or subsidies to politically aligned groups.

### Investigation Objectives
- Map all governmental layers and identify functional duplications
- Quantify total political positions (elected + appointed)
- Calculate cost of overlap and potential savings from consolidation
- Investigate nepotism in political appointments
- Identify subsidies flowing to politically aligned organizations

### Key Areas
- Federal vs. regional vs. community competency overlaps
- Administrative duplication (HR, IT, procurement, etc.)
- Political appointment processes and family/party connections
- Comparative analysis with other federal systems (Germany, Switzerland)

### Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive government structure map with overlap visualization
- Cost analysis: current system vs. streamlined alternatives
- Nepotism network documentation
- Reform scenarios with estimated savings

## 6. EU Asset and Aid Misuse Tied to Belgium

**Priority:** Medium
**Scope:** Belgium & EU (Foreign Policy)

### Overview
Investigate Belgium's handling of frozen Russian assets (PM De Wever's reluctance) and traceability of Ukraine aid/weapons, amid corruption concerns. Cross-check with broader EU fund misuse in Brussels (e.g., historical expense fiddling or Qatargate echoes).

### Investigation Objectives
- Document Belgium's position on frozen Russian assets and financial flows
- Trace Ukraine aid and weapons transfers for accountability
- Assess corruption risks in aid distribution
- Connect to broader EU fund misuse patterns (Qatargate, expense scandals)

### Key Entities
- **PM Bart De Wever** - stance on Russian assets
- Belgian foreign aid mechanisms
- EU institutions in Brussels (Parliament, Commission)
- Ukraine aid distribution channels

### Expected Deliverables
- Russian assets handling timeline and policy analysis
- Ukraine aid traceability assessment
- Corruption risk analysis
- Connections to historical EU scandals (Qatargate context)
