# Timeline: Persona-project Onderwijsadministratie

## Timeline Framework

This timeline documents the key events in the Persona-project from inception to its suspension in January 2026.

## Legacy System Era (1990s-2019)

### 1990s
- **Event:** Construction of AGODI's core personnel and payroll systems (EPD, VSS)
- **Details:** Legacy applications built to manage personnel data and salary calculations for all Flemish education staff
- **Significance:** These systems would still be in use 30+ years later, forming the critical infrastructure Persona was meant to replace
- **Source:** VRT NWS, AGODI official communications

### 2001-2019
- **Event:** Growing recognition of legacy system risks
- **Details:** Systems become increasingly complex, poorly documented, and dependent on a small group of specialists. Edison system handles data exchange between schools and AGODI.
- **Significance:** Key-person risk and technical debt accumulate, making modernization both urgent and increasingly difficult

## Project Decision and Setup (2020-2021)

### 2020
- **Event:** Flemish government decides to develop the Persona system
- **Details:** Under Minister of Education Ben Weyts (N-VA), the government approves development of a new IT platform for personnel administration and payroll processing at AGODI

## Procurement and Development Start (2022)

### 2025 (exact date TBD)

- **Significance:** Turning point — the project has spent everything with only 8-10% delivered
- **Source:** VRT NWS; parliamentary documents

### Late 2025
- **Event:** Minister Demir commissions external audit
- **Details:** Education Minister Zuhal Demir (N-VA), who succeeded Ben Weyts, orders an independent audit by Moore
- **Significance:** New minister's decision to scrutinize the project leads to the eventual crisis
