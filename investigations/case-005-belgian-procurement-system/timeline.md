- Cronos: Present in Persona, multiple federal projects
- Cegeka/DXC: Present in Persona, iPolice, justice projects
- Atos: Present across federal and regional failures

### Pattern 3: No Accountability
- No vendor has been barred from future contracts after project failure
- Framework contracts continue regardless of performance
- Individual project failures treated as isolated incidents

### Pattern 4: Expertise Gap Persists
- Government reliance on external consultants increases over time
- Internal IT capacity continues to decline relative to private sector
