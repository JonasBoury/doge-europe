# Research Notes: Digital Euro

## Key Angles to Pursue

### 1. The Amazon Question
Amazon was selected for UI prototyping in September 2022. For a project built on "European payment sovereignty," involving a US Big Tech company is contradictory. Worth investigating:
- How was Amazon selected? What was the procurement process?
- What data did Amazon access during prototyping?
- Was there political pushback?

### 2. eIDAS 2.0 Intersection
The EU's digital identity framework (eIDAS 2.0) and the digital euro are being developed in parallel. Together they could create a comprehensive digital identity + financial surveillance system. The interaction between these two projects needs scrutiny.

### 3. Cash Elimination Trajectory
While the regulation proposal includes protections for cash alongside the digital euro, the trend is clear:
- Cash usage declining across the eurozone
- Some countries (Netherlands, Sweden) already near cashless
- Digital euro could accelerate cash decline by providing a "good enough" digital alternative
- Once cash use falls below a threshold, maintaining cash infrastructure becomes uneconomical

The ECB says the digital euro "complements" cash. But does it accelerate cash's disappearance?

### 4. The Holding Limit Debate
The holding limit is the most politically contentious design choice:
- **Too high (€4,000+):** Threatens bank deposits and financial stability
- **Too low (€500-1,000):** Makes the digital euro useless for most purposes
- **Sweet spot (€1,500-3,000):** Still threatens smaller banks

The Parliament wants to shift power over limit-setting from the ECB to the Commission (via delegated acts). This is a significant governance question.

### 5. Vendor Concentration
All five selected component providers are EU-based (required by terms). But worth examining:
- Are these the same vendors that appear in other government IT failures?
- What is Capgemini's track record? (Appears twice in selections)
- €237M in framework contracts — how does this compare to other ECB procurements?

### 6. The "Never Programmable" Promise
The ECB states digital euro "will never be programmable money." But:
- This is a policy commitment, not a technical constraint
- No treaty or constitutional prohibition exists
- Future ECB leadership could reverse this
- China already uses programmable features in e-CNY
- In a crisis (war, pandemic), emergency powers could override normal rules

What legal safeguards exist? Are they sufficient?

## Open Questions

- [ ] What is the ECB's internal cost-benefit analysis? Has it been published?
- [ ] How do eurozone national central banks (especially Bundesbank, Banque de France) view the project?
- [ ] What lobbying has occurred around the EU regulation proposal?
- [ ] Are there MEPs publicly opposing the digital euro? Who, and why?
- [ ] What is the European Data Protection Supervisor's position?
- [ ] How does the digital euro interact with existing sanctions infrastructure?
- [ ] What happens to the digital euro if a eurozone country exits the euro?

## Follow-Up Research

1. FOI request to ECB for internal cost-benefit analysis
2. Map MEP positions ahead of H1 2026 vote
3. Interview European privacy advocates (EDRi, noyb)
4. Compare vendor selections with government IT failure cases
5. Analyze consultation responses to Commission proposal
