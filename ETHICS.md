# Research Ethics Guidelines

## Purpose

This document establishes ethical guidelines for using the DOGE Europe research assistant. Investigative research into political corruption and fraud serves the public interest, but must be conducted responsibly and ethically.

## Core Principles

### 1. Public Interest

**Legitimate Uses:**
- Exposing corruption and fraud
- Holding public officials accountable
- Promoting government transparency
- Supporting investigative journalism
- Academic research into political systems
- Civic engagement and informed citizenship

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Personal vendettas or harassment
- Defamation or character assassination
- Political opposition research for partisan gain alone
- Invasion of privacy without public interest justification
- Commercial exploitation of private information
- Doxxing or targeting private individuals

### 2. Truth and Accuracy

**Commitments:**
- Verify all claims with multiple credible sources
- Clearly distinguish between facts, allegations, and opinions
- Correct errors promptly and transparently
- Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations
- Present evidence objectively
- Consider alternative explanations

**Prohibitions:**
- Fabricating or distorting evidence
- Cherry-picking data to fit a narrative
- Presenting speculation as fact
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Misleading through selective omission
- Sensationalizing findings

### 3. Privacy and Harm Minimization

**Balancing Test:**
Public interest in disclosure must outweigh:
- Privacy interests of individuals
- Potential harm to innocent parties
- National security concerns (when legitimate)
- Ongoing law enforcement investigations

**Privacy Protections:**
- Minimize exposure of purely private information
- Protect non-public figures absent compelling justification
- Redact unnecessary personal details
- Consider impact on family members
- Respect victims and vulnerable individuals

**Special Protections:**
- Children and minors
- Victims of crimes
- Whistleblowers and confidential sources
- Private citizens peripherally connected to stories
- Medical and financial information

### 4. Source Protection

**Confidentiality:**
- Never reveal confidential sources without permission
- Use secure communications
- Remove identifying information from documents
- Resist legal pressure to disclose sources
- Maintain proper operational security

**Source Rights:**
- Explain how information will be used
- Honor agreements about attribution
- Protect sources from retaliation
- Don't mislead sources about intentions
- Give sources reasonable opportunity to reconsider

### 5. Legal Compliance

**Belgian Law Compliance:**
- Respect Belgian privacy laws (GDPR)
- Follow FOI request procedures properly
- Don't illegally obtain information yourself
- Understand libel and defamation law
- Respect court orders and legal restrictions
- Follow Belgian journalistic codes

**Whistleblower Protection:**

### 6. Independence and Conflicts of Interest

**Maintain Independence:**
- Disclose any conflicts of interest

- Maintain editorial independence

**Declare Conflicts:**
- Personal relationships with subjects

### 7. Right of Reply

**Fair Treatment:**

- Fairly present their responses
- Allow correction of factual errors
- Consider their perspective

**Exceptions:**
- When safety requires anonymity
- When subject would destroy evidence
- When delay would harm public interest
- When subject is clearly evading
- When subject has repeatedly refused

### 8. Proportionality

**Appropriate Methods:**
- Use least intrusive methods necessary
- Don't employ deception without compelling justification
- Match investigative intensity to importance
- Consider impact on all parties
- Use public records before seeking leaks

**Deception:**
Generally avoid deception. Use only when:
- Story is of vital public importance
- Information cannot be obtained by other means
- Public interest clearly outweighs deception
- Deception is disclosed in publication

### 9. Respect for Democratic Processes

**Support Democracy:**
- Promote informed citizenship
- Expose anti-democratic behavior
- Respect legitimate privacy of political process
- Distinguish between policy disagreement and corruption

**Not Partisan Warfare:**
- Apply same standards to all political parties
- Don't serve as opposition research arm
- Investigate corruption regardless of perpetrator
- Maintain objectivity and fairness

## Specific Scenarios

### Investigating Public Officials

**Enhanced Scrutiny Justified:**
- Public officials have reduced privacy expectations
- Public interest in their conduct is high
- Their decisions affect the public
- Accountability is essential to democracy

**Still Protected:**
- Purely private family matters
- Medical information
- Unrelated personal life
- Information without public interest nexus

### Investigating Private Individuals

**Higher Bar:**
- Private figures have greater privacy rights
- Require stronger public interest justification
- Focus on actions, not personal life
- Minimize identification when possible

**Justification Required:**
- Direct involvement in public corruption
- Beneficiaries of public corruption
- Gatekeepers enabling corruption
- Public interest outweighs privacy

### Using Leaked Documents

**Assessment Framework:**
1. **Authenticity**: Are documents genuine?
2. **Public Interest**: Does release serve public good?
3. **Harm Assessment**: Who could be harmed?
4. **Proportionality**: Is harm justified by public interest?
5. **Legality**: Could publishing create legal liability?

**Best Practices:**
- Verify thoroughly before publishing
- Consult legal counsel
- Redact unnecessary private information
- Protect source identity
- Consider phased release if appropriate

### International Investigations

**Cross-Border Considerations:**
- Different jurisdictions have different laws
- GDPR applies to Belgian/EU data
- Some countries have oppressive laws
- Source protection varies by country
- Libel tourism is real
